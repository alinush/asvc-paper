\section{Conclusion}
In this paper, we formalized a new cryptographic primitive called an \textit{aggregatable subvector commitment (aSVC)}, which is a \textit{subvector commitment (SVC)} scheme that supports aggregation and supports updating proofs and commitments.
Then, we gave an efficient aSVC construction based on KZG commitments to Lagrange polynomials, which outperforms previous work.
Lastly, we used our aSVC to build an efficient stateless cryptocurrency in the account model which outperforms previous work.

\parhead{Future Work.}
Our work leaves open interesting challenges in stateless cryptocurrencies.
First, the ability to aggregate update keys would further reduce block size.
Second, unbounded proof aggregation~\cite{CFG+20} could be used to further ``compress'' stateless blockchains.
Third, authenticated dictionaries \textit{with scalable updates} would remove the limitation on the number of users and eliminate DoS attacks on user registration.
