\section{Conclusion}
In this paper, we formalized a new cryptographic primitive called an \textit{aggregatable subvector commitment (aSVC)} that supports aggregating and updating proofs (and commitments) using only constant-sized, static auxiliary information referred to as an ``update key.''
We constructed an efficient aSVC from KZG commitments to Lagrange polynomials which, compared to other pairing-based schemes, can precompute, aggregate and update proofs efficiently and, compared to schemes from hidden-order groups, has smaller proofs and should perform better in practice.
Lastly, we continued the study of stateless validation initiated by Chepurnoy et al., improving block validation time and block size, while addressing attacks and limitations.
We hope our work will ignite further research into stateless validation for payments and smart contracts and lead to improvements both at the theoretical and practical level.
